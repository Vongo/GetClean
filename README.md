# FAQ

Q : Do I have to download the dataset, unzip it, and put it inside whatever folder you want ? <br/>
A : You can do it if you really want to. Or let the script manage this for you.

Q : It doesn't work, package not found !! <br/>
A : Simply uncomment the install.package line (at the top of run_analysis.R) corresponding to the error you get. I guess it's because of the "downloader" package, which is great BTW. Very easy to use, and works well !

Q : Why the hell did you write a FAQ ? <br/>
A : Why the hell are you reading it ?

Q : What grade do you want ? <br/>
A : Hum, tough question. What grade would you give me ?
